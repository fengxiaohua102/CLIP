**Compact light field tomography (CLIP)** is a framework for efficient light field imaging using sensors of arbitray formats.
This repository contains the core codes and experimental data for demonstrating and reproducing the results in the manuscript
&#39;Compact light field tomography toward versatile three-dimensional vision &#39;.

**Requirements:**

MATLAB (with 3rd party toolbox BM3D).

CUDA-capable GPU device for acceleration.

**Optional** : Paraview (for 3D results visualization).

**Instructions for running the codes:**

1. CLIP0D\_ExpRecon2D.m is the main script for CLIP with 0D sensor reconstruction of 2D refocused images.

2. CLIP0D\_ExpRecon4D.m is the main script for CLIP with 0D sensor reconstruction of 4D light field.

3. CLIP1D\_Recon2D.m is the main script for CLIP with 1D sensor reconstruction of 2D refocused images.

4. CLIP1D\_Recon4D.m is the main script for CLIP with 1D sensor reconstruction of 4D light field.
